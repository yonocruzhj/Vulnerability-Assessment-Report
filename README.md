# <h1>**Vulnerability Assessment Report**</h1>

# <h2>**Description**</h2>
This project consists of creating a vulnerability assessment report for a small company, in order to demonstrate the severity and risk of leaving their database server open to the public.
<br />

# <h2> **Goal** </h2>
The goal is to communicate to shareholders and management team the potential consequences of leaving their database server open to the public, as well as provide reccomendations to improve the company's current situation.

# <h2>**Framework and Guidelines** </h2>

- <b>NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1 </b>

 **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

## **1st January 20XX**

## ---

# **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# **Purpose**

The database server is an integral part for ensuring business operations run efficiently. The server is a centralized system that stores and manages large volumes of data, including customer information, campaign details, and analytics. This data can be analyzed to track performance and personalize marketing strategies. Securing this system is essential due to its critical role in supporting marketing operations and keeping an advantage over competitors. 

# **Risk Assessment**

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Hacker* | *Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration* | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| *Employee* | *Disrupt mission-critical operations* | *2* | *3* | *6* |
| *Customer* | *Alter/Delete critical information* | *1* | *3* | *3* |

# **Approach**

The assessment evaluated risks related to the company’s data storage and management practices. Potential threat sources and scenarios were identified by analyzing the probability of a security incident based on the system’s open access permissions. The potential severity of these incidents was then measured against their potential impact on daily business operations. Considering the likelihood and severity of the security incident were the major factors in determining the incident’s risk level.

# **Remediation Strategy**

Future  implementation should include authentication, authorization, and auditing measures to restrict database server access to authorized users only. Various options include enforcing strong password policies, employing role-based access controls, and utilizing multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Data in transit is encrypted using TLS instead of SSL, and configuring the firewall via IP allow-listing to permit connections only from devices within corporate offices which will prevent unauthorized access from external sources.

# <h2>**Summary** </h2>
Using the NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1 as a guideline, I successfully performed a vulnerability assessment of the company's database server open permission access. This assessment allowed me to communicate the importance of securing the database server to the company as well as provide them mulitple solutions to enhancing their security posture.
